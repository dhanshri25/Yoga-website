<p style="text-align :center;font-size: 20px;">Yoga can make you stronger and more flexible. It's a great way to stay limber and energetic. You'll also feel more focused and alert.</p> 
<p style="text-align :center;font-size: 20px;margin-bottom: 50px">And yoga can help you feel great and function better in your daily life. Yoga can also help improve these conditions:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px">Yoga's gentle movements are a big reason for why it’s so popular. Yoga is good for people who haven't been active in a while. It’s good for people who have certain health conditions like arthritis or osteoporosis. You can change the exercises to fit your needs. But yoga is also great if you're already fit and want a challenging workout. As you become more strong and flexible with yoga, it's easier to do other kinds of exercise like dancing, walking, or swimming.<p>

  <li>Increase your concentration. A main part of yoga is rhythmic, focused breathing. This can help you focus.</li>
  <li>Understand the mind and body connection. Yoga requires you to focus all your energy on each movement or pose exactly. This can help you feel the mind and body work together.</li>
  <li>Gain strength and stamina. More vigorous styles of yoga promote strength and stamina.</li>
  <li>Improve balance and stability. Balancing poses require you to use your core muscles. This can help you improve your overall stability.</li>
