 <font face="candara" size="5">Over the last few decades, there has been an upsurge in the prevalence of yoga. Medical professionals and celebrities are also adopting and recommending the regular practice of yoga due its various benefits. While some regard yoga as simply one more prevailing fashion and associate it with the new age mysticism, others vouch for how astonishing this form of exercise feels. 
 What they don't understand is that what they see as simply just another form of exercise will profit them in ways they never envisioned.</font></p>
 
 <p><font face="candara" size='5'>Before we get into the benefits of Yoga, it is essential to understand what exactly Yoga really is. 
 Yoga is not a religion, itâ€™s a way of living that aims towards a healthy mind in a healthy body. Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being; Yoga helps in developing the balance between all the three as stated in  Ayurveda in India. Other forms of exercise, like aerobics, only assure physical wellbeing. 
 These exercises have very little to do with the improvement of spiritual or astral body.</font></p>
 
 <p><font face="candara" size='5'>The perfect unison can be achieved through Hatha Yoga and its various branches (Ashtanga Yoga, Iyengar Yoga, 
 Bikram Yoga, Yin Yoga, Kundalini Yoga), 
 depending on what you like and the problems you are looking to tackle through the practice.</font></p>
